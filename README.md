# Libtf

The libft library is the first project you tackle at 42. Its objective is to reprogram functions from the standard C library, along with additional routines that will be useful in future projects. It aims to teach and reinforce fundamental low-level and C programming concepts, ranging from variables, functions, pointers and data types to strings, arrays, memory allocation and linked lists. This project also emphasizes understanding how memory works, the differences between the heap and the stack, and how data is managed within these areas.

## Overview

This project consists of three parts:

### Libc Functions

The functions created in the bonus section serve as an introduction to linked lists, a very powerful tool when dealing with projects that require handling complex data sets.

#### ft_lstnew

```
t_list *ft_lstnew(void *content);

## One Final Note

For many, this project marked their first serious encounter with programming beyond the 42 pool, so many functions are not entirely efficient or well-written. However, although I could rewrite and optimize some of them, for now I prefer to leave them as they are. I enjoy revisiting from time to time to see how it was the first time I programmed, for example, ft_strjoin or ft_split, thinking about how I would do it now, and realizing how much I've improved in programming.
